                        The sun smells like lemons and your life shines golden. Don't resist, don't struggle, let yourself be carried away. The garden is poisonous, and the vines want to choke you, and the soft greens and bright yellows turn to reds and purples when you're not looking—but the scents are heavenly, and the fruits divine.

                        The ten thousandth night is inching closer. Hold yourself tight into your palms or you'll fade away. Don't let the skies turn dark, the cherries rancid, the syrup bitter. Don't let it slip from your teeth. If you can hold on to it you'll die scorched—beautiful, blazing, with your heart on fire. They'll never forget you.

                        That's not how you win the game. Roar all you want, be a bully, be a poser. Nobody cares whether you want to play or not. You can't leave the table, so you better think carefully about how to play your cards. The game's rigged against you—but you might still win. You just need to find the right way to bend the rules.

                        Break your pen against the stars and sew your eyes shut. You heard the crows flapping their wings about and craw-craw-crawing about the approaching storm. You can see it on the horizon. Don't say you weren't warned.

                        You keep gazing at the night sky trying to decipher the secret woven in the constellations, you look for clues in the singing of the crickets, you grope for messages in cups of deep sweet wine. What you find is not an answer, but a question. What you see is your own eyes staring back at you.
