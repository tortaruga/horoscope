                But summer cannot last forever, and peaches start to rot and sunflowers have no sun to turn to. 
                Now all you have is empty skies and ants crawling in your chest.</p>

              The sea is calling you. Your name tastes of salt, and blue, and storm, and a cruel song that slashes your ears and cuts you up from the inside. You dance so violent, chain between your teeth, fire between your lashes. I looked into your eyes, but you were not there.

                You left a kiss on the ice and now your heart is frozen. The days are starting to decay. There are things that cannot be said, and silences that will keep festering in your throat. Cut off your tongue. Spit it in the face of the sun, howl with blood-stained teeth. Nothing will change.

                Staring into cracked mirrors won't do you any good. Crush violets and poppies and brew your summer wine. Are you growing horns? Maybe you just need a very cold shower.

                Aren't you tired? Blue lips and red eyes, keep spinning as confetti explode all around you. Your medicine is also your poison. Turn me to stone, you plead, but the snakes hiss and keep smothering your heart. There's no alabaster tower to seek shelter in. Only flesh—soft, naked, rotting flesh.

                The sun smells like lemons and your life shines golden. Don't resist, don't struggle, let yourself be carried away. The garden is poisonous, and the vines want to choke you, and the soft greens and bright yellows turn to reds and purples when you're not looking—but the scents are heavenly, and the fruits divine.

                The ten thousandth night is inching closer. Hold yourself tight into your palms or you'll fade away. Don't let the skies turn dark, the cherries rancid, the syrup bitter. Don't let it slip from your teeth. If you can hold on to it you'll die scorched—beautiful, blazing, with your heart on fire. They'll never forget you.

                That's not how you win the game. Roar all you want, be a bully, be a poser. Nobody cares whether you want to play or not. You can't leave the table, so you better think carefully about how to play your cards. The game's rigged against you—but you might still win. You just need to find the right way to bend the rules.

What you find is not an answer, but a question. What you see is your own eyes staring back at you.
